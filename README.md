# Hydra

A quick puzzle game where you try to cut off all a hydra's heads
before it eats you.

Play it here: https://jonathanacross.github.io/hydra/

The game is pretty self-explanatory after you try it a few times,
but here are the rules:

* You must get to *exactly* zero heads for the hydra to die.
* Weapons can't be used if they are designed to cut off more heads
  than the hydra currently has; for example, a Knife (-9) will
  kill a hydra with 9 heads, but is useless if the hydra has only 8.
* Similarly, a Bisector (/2) weapon that cuts the heads in half
  will only work if there is an even number of heads.
* Some weapons cause the hydra to grow additional heads.
  Use these to your advantage.
